Assignment 3 - Behavioral Study : Visual working memory and effects of interference. 
The study looks into the visuo-spatial sketchpad and the kind of input that can be filtered through, and perhaps cause interference when there is absence of attention. The study is a adapted and modified from Ueno, Taiji, Richard J. Allen, Alan D. Baddeley, Graham J. Hitch, and Satoru Saito. 2011. “Disruption of Visual Feature Binding in Working Memory.” Memory & Cognition 39(1):12–23. doi: 10.3758/s13421-010-0013-8. 
File: Assignment3_Behavioral_study.py consists of the python codes for the experimental setup, which was constructed using Psychopy3 Coder. 

Assignment3_Files/LogFiles consists of the logfiles of the five participants. 
Assignment3_Files/Stimuli_Images consists of the images used for the experimental stimuli. 
The foulder also contains an excel sheet of the results, manually calculated from the logfiles.
